                        holidays. (Who wouldn't if they lived with the horrible Dursleys?) But when Harry gets to

                        the atmosphere is tense. There's an escaped mass murderer on the loose, and the sinister prison
                        guards of Azkaban have been called in to guard the school...</p>

                        Unlike most schoolboys, Harry never enjoys his summer holidays, but this summer is even worse
                        than usual. The Dursleys, of course, are making his life a misery, but even his best friends,
                        Ron and Hermione, seem to be neglecting him.</p>

                    <p>It is the middle of the summer, but there is an unseasonal mist pressing against the windowpanes.
                        Harry Potter is waiting nervously in his bedroom at the Dursleys' house in Privet Drive for a
                        visit from Professor Dumbledore himself. One of the last times he saw the Headmaster, he was in
                        a fierce one-to-one duel with Lord Voldemort, and Harry can't quite believe that Professor
                        Dumbledore will actually appear at the Dursleys' of all places. Why is the Professor coming to
                        visit him now? What is it that cannot wait until Harry returns to Hogwarts in a few weeks' time?
                        Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts has already got off to an unusual start, as the worlds of Muggle
                        and magic start to intertwine...</p>

                        so full of shadows. But Harry must somehow find within himself the strength to complete the task
                        he has been given. He must leave the warmth, safety and companionship of The Burrow and follow
                        without fear or hesitation the inexorable path laid out for him...</p>
